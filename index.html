                <p>The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing.Have you urinated? Have you drained your bladder? Are you free?</p>

                <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You gotta think like a tree. Only eight colors that you need. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>
                <p>This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Just beat the devil out of it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let that brush dance around there and play. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>
